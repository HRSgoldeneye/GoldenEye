		On the official Hawai’i Government Website, <a href="https://portal.ehawaii.gov/government/hawaii-legislature/hawaii-revised-statutes/">Hawaiʻi Revised Statutes</a>, over 20,000 sections, with no database and no way to search for a particular statute or section, the statutes are on a file server. This means that it's another obstacle to update or edit statutes. Currently, the statutes are officially updated once a year. With this slow process, there is no consistency and typos are common for some statutes. </p>
